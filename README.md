# Titanic

This project was created for the Kaggle competition.  The main goal is to predict which of the passengers survived and which did not. 

There are two data sets: `train.csv`, `test.csv`. Train.csv contains data about a subset of passengers on board (891 to be exact) and, importantly, will show whether or not they survived, which is also known as "ground truth". The `test.csv` dataset contains similar information, but does not reveal the "ground truth" for each passenger. 

Before creating the prediction algorithm, an exploratory analysis of the data was performed, through which some patterns in the data were found.

My model scored 0.76076, meaning that it was able to correctly predict 76% of the survivors and none of the test sample. This is my first project (after studying) in which I used models for prediction.

# scraping_sreality

The purpose of my work was to gain experience in parsing sites and additionally to do a little research on the analysis of apartment sales in Prague.

As a result of parsing I received 5397 rows with ads. Each row contains 10 columns. It was an interesting experience to get the data from the website and also to get some insights about real estate in Prague.
